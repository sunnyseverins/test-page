                        Something akin to an article with its serious message and lots of text. There is a lot of it. It describes how one thing can be elaborated to that extend, that it can occupy pretty a lot of space by providing little to none information. Yeah, it was made via flex container, which I believe must contain similar objects, yet I chose it to show 2 different objects as something akin to a book description in those technical literature. Yeah, I may shrink it, but it can be done alternatively, say, via "grid", although not sure is it useful across the web development world. And mobile-web adaptation... I want to make so many things, yet stuck doing everything one-by-one which is not wrong, but a little sad. Also, that menu is dysfunctional, but I believe you already tapped there; who could've guessed that nothing will happen?
